# Overview

## Purpose

This page exists to communicate and facilitate getting the right stuff done quickly.  
It provides a common place to share information about what is happening and what still needs to happen.

## Process

All team activity should fall under one of the listed actions and move us toward a Target Result.  
If we find ourselves doing something outside of the listed actions then we should either stop or add it to the list. :)  
Please update this page as soon as it makes sense to you!

TBD: Frequency of calls and/or meetings?
